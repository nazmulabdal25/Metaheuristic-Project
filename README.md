# Sprint Capacity Maximum Utilization by Genetic Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm to maximize sprint capacity utilization. The algorithm optimizes the allocation of resources within a sprint to achieve the best possible efficiency. There are two datasets named "task_200.csv" and "team_members.csv" which were created using the "data_set_maker.py" python file.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.13.2

## Installation

To install the required package, run:
```bash
pip install pandas==2.2.3
```

## How to Run

Execute the `genetic_algorithm.py` file using the following command:
```bash
python genetic_algorithm.py
```

## Features
- Uses a Genetic Algorithm to optimize sprint capacity utilization.
- Leverages Pandas for data handling and processing.
- Customizable parameters for tuning the Genetic Algorithm.
