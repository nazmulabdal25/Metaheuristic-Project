The code is available in GA_Code.py file. Two datasets are given with the names tasks_200.csv and team_members.csv. The datasets comprise two distinct sets of information necessary for optimizing sprint capacity utilization using a genetic algorithm. These datasets provide details on tasks, projects, and team members, forming the basis for the scheduling and allocation process. The first dataset consists of 200 tasks categorized under 7 different projects. Each task is characterized by a unique identifier, its associated project, and an estimated completion time. This dataset provides the foundational task information necessary for scheduling team members based on their expertise and availability. The second dataset contains information about the team members who will execute the tasks. Each team member has specific training in certain projects and a defined daily working capacity. This dataset defines the constraints regarding which team members can work on which tasks and their daily capacity, ensuring that task assignments align with project-specific expertise. 
The code and the datasets can be easily downloaded and run to get the final results.
